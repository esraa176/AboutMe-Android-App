# AboutMe-Android-App
 
This is the first toy app for lesson 2 of the Android App Development in Kotlin course on Udacity.

## AboutMe
The AboutMe app is a demo app that shows information about a person like:
- Name
- Settable Nickname
- An image
- Scrollable information


This app demonstrates the following views and techniques:
- LinearLayout (Vertical)
- TextView
- EditText
- ImageView
- ScrollView
- Setting multiple click handlers programmatically
- Using data binding for views to improve performance instead of findViewById that needs to traverse the entire hierarchy tree and takes time.
